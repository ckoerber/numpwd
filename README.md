# numpwd

Python module to convert two-nucleon operators from math-expressions (sympy) to partial wave decomposed arrays in momentum space.

## Description

This module exports two-nucleon operators (like external currents) specified by latex-like expressions in momentum space to arrays in a partial wave basis:

$$
	\hat O
	=
	f(\hat p_o, \hat p_i, \hat q)
	\vec sigma_1 \cdot (\vec p_o - \vec p_i)
	\vec sigma_1 \cdot (\vec p_o - \vec p_i)
	\to
	O_{(l_o s_o)j_o m_{j_o} (l_i s_i)j_i m_{j_i}}(p_o, p_i, \vec{q})
$$

where ` o, i`  indicate incoming or outgoing quantities and nuclear channels are coupled in an `(ls)j` scheme.

It utilizes sympy to convert expressions to arrays on CPU (numpy) or GPU  (cupy) and integrates out angular dependence to project on partial wave channels.

## Details

For general spin-dependent operators, array dimensions (complex numbers) can be quite large: `(c_s, p_o, p_i, q, x_o, x_i, phi_o, phi_i)`, where

* `c_s` specifies the number of in and outgoing spin channels ~ 10
* `p` specifies the momentum grid  ~ 60
* `q` the external momentum values ~ 10
* `x` the polar angle values ~ 20
* `phi` the azimuthal angle values ~ 50

which corresponds to `10 * 60**2 * 10 * 20**2 * 50**2 * 16B ~ 5TB` if one would try to entirely allocate this array at once.

To allow computational optimizations like vectorization, this module utilizes the Wignerâ€“Eckart theorem to reduce the number of allowed channels.
For a large class of operators of interest, this also allows to run one integration analytically (also done under the hood) such that intermediate arrays for large operators are at the size of `5GB`.

To further speed up computations, intermediate results like Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are repeated integrals are cached.

The notebook folder specifies more details and provides examples.
