# dm-op32

This folder contains the PWD of operator c32.

It is split into two parts:

1. the spin PWD where the latex expression is converted to a nuclear spin matrix element and one angle is integrated out analytically
2. the angular PWD where the remaining angles of the previous result are integrated out.
